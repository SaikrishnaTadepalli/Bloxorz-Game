# Bloxorz Game

This is a remake of the classic puzzle game, Bloxorz, built using Unity 3D and C#. 

The game challenges players to maneuver a 1-by-1-by-2 block through a series of mazes and obstacles to reach a designated endpoint in a particular block orientation. The block is controlled by the arrow keys where it rolls in the direction given by the input.

This game extends the classic Bloxorz by adding new types of traps and enemy blocks. Additionally, this version also features time-sensitive reaction based levels alongside the classic puzzle based levels.
## Features
